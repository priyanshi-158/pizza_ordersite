# Pizzarita- A pizza-ordering site

The website is a basic model of a pizza-ordering site. Users can explore various options and add their choices to the cart. The pagination makes it very simple for the users to see all the menu items easily without scrolling much. Using redux-toolkit the cart page of the project has smoothly been made which allows the user to view their added items and the total cost that they have to pay when placing an order. For the styling and designing of the page, Tailwind CSS proved to be of great help. The website is authenticated i.e. users sign up before adding the items to the cart. The Mongo DB database stores the data of products and the information of the users.

### Tech Stacks Used:
React JS, Tailwind CSS, Express JS, Mongo DB

### Libraries Used:
React-redux, React-router-dom, Redux-toolkit, React-spinners

### Development Environment:
VS code, git, Vercel

Deployed version: [[Pizzerita](https://pizza-ordersite.vercel.app/)]

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
